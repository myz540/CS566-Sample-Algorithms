# CS566-Sample-Algorithms

## HW4
Binary search tree

## HW5
Recursive fibonacci sequence, uses naive and memoized (dynamic programming)

## HW6
Binary knapsack problem. Contains top-down naive recursive solution and a memoized 
bottom-up solution. A solution for the unbounded knapsack problem is provided as well 
using the memoized bottom-up method. 

## HW7
Implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum-spanning tree for a given 
graph. The algorithm is greedy and provides locally optimal solutions. This can be run on
any non-directional weighted graph.
